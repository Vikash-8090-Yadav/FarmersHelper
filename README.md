## Working Flow !!

- **Listing Products**: Farmers can easily list their products on our website.

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each product is represented as a unique digital asset called an NFT (non-fungible token), ensuring it has its own digital identity that can't be replicated or divided.

- **Buy and Resell**: Anyone can buy these NFT products from the farmers, and once someone owns an NFT, they can resell it to others.

- **Case Registration**: If a farmer isn't satisfied with how a particular item is being treated or represented, they can register a case for it to maintain the integrity and reputation of their products.

- **Transparency**: The complete history of transactions and interactions with the smart contract is visible to anyone, providing full transparency into how products are bought, sold, and handled, which adds trust and accountability to the entire process.
